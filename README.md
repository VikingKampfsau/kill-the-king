## Overview

Kill the King (KtK) is a mod which changes the Call of Duty 4 experience dramatically by dividing teams in two groups - assassins and guardians.<br/>
At first, one lone assassin must strive to kill the king - whilst dodging the guardians.<br/>
Killing a guardian will respawn him as an assassin, who can then help to kill the King.<br/>
